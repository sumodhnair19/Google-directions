# Optional Info:-
1) Google Maps require an API key to work, and currently I am using my own API key. If in case you want to change it and use yours, then please change it by doing the following:

    Go to file -> front-end->src->sharedComponent->config->constants.js
   
    Look for googleAPIKey and update.
