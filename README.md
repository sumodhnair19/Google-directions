# Not Mandatory but just for your info:-
1) Google Maps require API, and currently I am using my own API key. If in case you want to change it and use yours, then please change it by doing the following:
 Go to file -> front-end->src->sharedComponent->config->constants.js
 Look for googleAPIKey and change it.
